<h2>&nbsp <li>Font Scheme</li></h2>

<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I aim to apply minimalistic design principles in order to maximize user experience. One of the most essential elements in a minimalist design is typography. <br>
The use of the font family Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif for my header and title makes a direct difference compared to the default setting of font because one key different is the  <br>
letter-spacing, which is a bit more generous than that of the conventional fonts such as Arial and Serifs, affecting the way it looks in virtually all setting, large and small blocks <br>
of text, graphics, heading etc. I wish to create the sense of modern and contemporary look of my website because the idea of patio gardening and living a healthy lifestyle nowadays  <br>
have been widely populated across different generations, gardening no longer targets old generation, young generations have also show trends to participate. Therefore, I felt that this <br>
was necessary and would add to the quality of the font, as well as my website,as a congruent letter spacing is pleasing to the eye. The font family Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif is <br>
comprised of predominantly classically-shaped geometric letters, so it has a clean crisp appearance without as much spacing between the letters.<br>
</p>

<h2>&nbsp <li>Color Scheme</li></h2>


 <P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The color scheme of the website uses green as the main colour juxtaposed against with light green and red. <br>
 The idea of choosing green as the main colour of the website is because green represents the idea of harmony and balance, growth and simplicity. <br>
 Using green throughout my website design creates the sense of nurturing as taking care of plants takes great patience and persistence. <br>
 However, I made some eventual modification against my conceptual colour design because I find out that in order to create a cohesive layout, <br>
 it is necessary to establish contrast in your web page, yet very high contrast are difficult to achieve with color combination other than black and white, <br>
 thus I choose to apply different tones of green such as emerald green and aqua green to create contrast between my navigation bar and banner. <br></p>
 
 <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In my conceptual design, I set the background to be a solid green color (analogue) as opposed to a complimentary color for the purpose of a coherent design. <br>
 But in some parts, I also used discordant colours such as red to be eye-catching and as attention-getting devices.<br>
 But in my final website, I decide to abandon the use of red because red does not seem to fit into the entire patio concept other than being eye-catching. <br>
 I also uploaded our own heading image to personalize the look of the site.

  <h1><strong></strong></h1> 
  <h2><li>Lines & Border Scheme</li></h2>
  <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The use of lines and borders add to the style of my design and allows me to really group and organize my information in a readable manner. For example, <br>
  in the guide page, I used very thin borders and separator lines in my popular article section to reflect the visual quality of my body font. Again, the entire <br>
  design strives to achieve a minimalist visual effect, thus the use of very lightweight borders around each section of the web page enables me to group and divide <br>
  my content effectively. In this way, the segmentation of my web page is clear to avoid disruption and overly complex layout. Most importantly, the style of my lines <br>
  and borders is congruent with the rest of the design to reinforce the idea of consistency. Last but not least, the use of grids allows the headers and content <br>
  paragraphs in Green Patio to appear more organized and ordered. Grids also help web designers achieve the minimalist look with sufficient white space.<br>
  </p>
  
  <h1><strong></strong></h1> 
  <h2><li>Assumptions</li></h2>
  
  <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
  There are several assumptions need to be made in order to understand the limitation of the website. Due to the limitation of time, the visual aesthetics has become my <br>
  main focus of this project. For example, I spent most of my time playing around with different fonts and grouping different elements into a visually pleasant manner as <br>
  opposed to implementing the a lot of the actual functionality using javascript such as sign up and login which has originally been my primary objectives in the design<br>
  phase. However, fonts on the web are limited, as designers, we only get access to a small selection of fonts that will be installed on most users' computers. <br>
  So I had to import fonts from other resources to ensure the creative look. It became clear to me that building up a full structure of the website appears more important <br>
  than just worrying about a specific function.</p>

  <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   As I have already stressed in my font scheme, I deem minimalistic design is effective in eliminating any complexities to a <br>
  design and to make a simple, elegant and minimal in the use of technologies and content. For example, I eliminate design unnecessary pattern and gradient background images<br>
  and replace it with a solid color that is light to make the content standout and the main focus. I also use color contrasts between the typography and the color to emphasise <br>
  on important text and provide a better page flow. In addition, I removed unnecessary graphical icons and images that make the design otherwise crowded.<br>
