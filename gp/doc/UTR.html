<h1><strong>Task Three: Usability Test Report</strong></h1> 
<h2>Purpose of the study</h2>
<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The goal of the website is to provide information for New Zealand Based gardeners and to help them manage their patio gardens. <br>
The entire design and usability was focused around the key goal of providing organized information rather than a commercial purpose. <br>
Given this presumption, my design reflects the end goal of the website. When the user arrives on the homepage, they are greeted with <br>
a well organized navigation menu and automatically sliding images. These visual cues help people understand that Patio Green is an <br>
information based website rather than a blog for marketing purposes. As a simple information based website, I will choose to analyze <br>
two components of Jakob Neilson's heuristic analysis in relation to my website. Since the website does not use any advanced features <br>
which means that many of the question about error handling, recovery and user control are not needed in this analysis. I used Morae <br>
as means to record my tester's browsing experience as an account in order to document any findings and issues. Since in this case, my <br>
primary stakeholder is my tester. I will look at "Consistency and Standards" and "Flexibility and Efficiency of Use". <br>
</p>
<h2> Findings and Corrections</h2>
<h3><li>Consistency and Standards - Ease of Learning</li></h3>
	<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After a user arrives on the homepage, the navigation structure is intuitive and non-obstructive. It replicates systems other websites <br>
	use - a title at the top of the page, a drop-down navigation system. This is to decrease any friction that user may face using the site, <br>
	meaning that they can rely on their memory of other websites to guide them around rather than scrutinize the website to figure out what <br>
	to do. Once they enter into the website, the basic interface they encounter remains the same - the same header, navigation, and sidebars,<br>
	are often used to distinguish between different areas of a website. Patio green is not that advanced and does not require any changes in <br>
	visual continuity to make this point to the user.
	</p> 
	
 <h2><li>Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</li></h2>
 <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp During the usability testing phase, I have discovered a few usability issues with regards to my Guide page, in the testing video, from<br>
 the testing video, I noticed that after after viewing the article, users ought to be given the right to comment on each article, so that <br>
it allows each one of user to be able to share their thoughts, so a text field that allows them to contribute ideas would be necessary to have.<br>
Taken as a whole, the simple, familiar layout of our website allows the content of four website to shine rather than confuse users with too much<br>
information. </p>

<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Last but not least, one of the features which has an impact to the efficiency of use is the adoption of responsive design.<br>
The responsive design maintains the aspect ratio of the website when user perform enlargement and shrinkage of ther browser. More importantly,<br>
it provides an optimal viewing experience, much more easier for user to read and navigate with a munimum of resiszing, panning and scrolling.<br>
Although I did take the a risk with putting the light text on a light backgound, I mitigated many of the usability standards with color<br>
choice and layout design. In order to optimize the efficiency of use, I deem it is closely associated with the design, my goal was to avoid<br>
 any disruptions in using the website so that users could immerse themselves in leanrning about the patio gardening information. I used a <br>
minimalist color scheme, replying only on emerald and aloe green to accentuate header text and links in the the shades of orange. <br>
